# Patient-Readmission-Analysis-
## Objective
Predict if a patient will be readmitted within 30 days of discharge using healthcare data.

## Dataset
- Source: [UCI Diabetes 130-US hospitals dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008)

## Workflow
1. Data Loading & Cleaning
2. Feature Engineering
3. Model Training (Random Forest)
4. Evaluation (ROC AUC, Confusion Matrix)
5. Deployment (Model Export)

âœ… Outcome:

This project enables healthcare providers to:

Identify high-risk patients.
Improve post-discharge care plans.
Reduce hospital penalties due to high readmission rates.
